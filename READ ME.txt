GAME ONLY WORKS IN 1280X720. I apologise

I'll have a video up tomorrow some time on how to play. Check https://pangoempire.wordpress.com/

redefine keys in unity launcher or use defaults:
enter num pad to start game, numpad keys incl. diags to move
movement is skating and a bit weird and rotationallllllly.
press the exact opposite of the way you're facing to "stop"
your speed affects things like if you bump an obstacle at speed you crash
and mob vs. mob combat uses speed.

aim of game is to clear 10 levels
to get off each level find the warp beads then head to the warp gate!
