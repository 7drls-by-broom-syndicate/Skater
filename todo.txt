there's a new? bug where minimap crashes out 
i think it was fov and lights file, line 113
index out of range
happened even before title screen had disappeared and in game too
and in the next game after that- so not just bad seed?
it could somehow be etilesprite.empty which is -1 so would be out of range?
but how would a displaychar get set to .empty?

invis mob bug still happens. easy to get it to appear using mouse click
to move but hard to tell what causes it when doing that.

make ignite blood only used when near player


foreach(var obj in from o in someList where o.SomeBooleanTest select o)
{
    //do stuff
}





snow covered rocks are getting blood on them from rain of blood
...and water...

		
UI has hp speed level score then square for beads, square for attack up, then square for defence up. after that there are 3 squares i think to
put items to use in
maybe make a hand icon for "held" and put in extreme right then to the left of it you put the item in hand
		
2. content: items
	
	which, if any, for barrels and which for moop crate?
	
	piece of meat to attrackt wolf
	bomb to throw
	trap to set
	scroll of ice cube
	scroll of fire lance
	speed potion
	special potion (gives special)		
		papa greebo: carpet of muhkittens (bunch of 1hp mobs)
		pango: tung grab (grab item)
		marsby: maxim strike (damage mobs)
		polarmoop: dance (moop and enemies dance and they take damage)
	a hopped up fox!
	
	another idea: item: fishing kit: get fish from water. hp back
	or even eat fish - low hp regain, be standing on blood when
	ignited, fish gets fried. full hp back on eat. almost becomes
	like an adventure game
	
	idea for another potion: coldproof for crossing water
	
	do we have mouseover for buffs? as in cairn off defnse
	

	
4. no map unsolvable	

	make henge stones items too so can bomb? or floodtest
	
	bugs that don't matter that much. resist urge to fix!
	problem:trees generating in snow-topped boulders
	reason:boulders take a free space then slide to the edge. they need to 
	put that free space back or only peek at it if possible, then they need to unfreespace what they land on. the slide 	has to check for trees and cairns by checking itemgrid is null, not just check displaychar
	
	check floodfill of level before barrels because they can be destroyed. 
	
	sometimes can't get into house because door inaccessible
	 due to edge of map

	we do need to fix that hillock thing- spawned in one, couldn't move
	
	
5. balancing of difficulty after adding new mobs and items. increase mob# ?

6. attack grid



moopwater is not being set to nopass

enemy adjacent to you turns to face you


enemy should skate up to you, can hit you and end up drifting past
(enemies coast as they attack)

polarmoops in water need to check for other polarmoops for passablility
deal with offscreen damage messages being ridiculously off edge

make it so it's easier to turn on ice when stopped but not snow

before starting the game, see if any mobs too close to player and if
so walk them away from the player like flee style

add concept of buffs and debuffs. 
	freezing
	bleeding
	attack up, down
	def up, down
	






better indication of speed, both player and mobs'

general suspicious slowdown after adding game state code





if you ever destroy a lantern regen lighting
when you activate a cairn, redo lighting (dostaticlights())

stop player turning lantern on and off it's always on





eventually, not 7drl:

procedural blood

low priority
when you crit (random) you cause bleeding and same on you by enemies
sound effect - hum of warp gate increases with proximity
ripples on pond
make walls item not map feature so you can blow em up
a little pffffffft shower of snow particles when you turn and stop
change item instance so it includes the extra data and get rid of extradata. or make item instance just the tile not a class
need to take damage if on blood when ignited
