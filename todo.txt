you attack mobs

enemy should skate up to you, can hit you and end up drifting past
(enemies coast as they attack)

do cairns

moopwater is not being set to nopass

enemy adjacent to you turns to face you

maybe snow

game over screen for win

you can walk in water

why do some enemies face north and never move until you get closer?
i suspect a nonpassable invisible. new theory: it's a* cutting out as it 
does for player

polarmoops in water need to check for other polarmoops for passablility




deal with offscreen damage messages being ridiculously off edge


do attackgrid thing

we do need to fix that hillock thing- spawned in one, couldn't move

make it so it's easier to turn on ice when stopped but not snow


why exactly does click move stop?




before starting the game, see if any mobs too close to player and if
so walk them away from the player like flee style



do breaking barrels. can actually do when moving











add concept of buffs and debuffs. 
	freezing
	bleeding
	attack up, down
	def up, down
	shortcut: do warp beads as a buff
	
	
change item instance so it includes the extra data and get rid of extradata. or make item instance just the tile not a class.

idea for another potion: coldproof for crossing water
to use something, open crate etc. you need to stop first, (alternative
is to stop the player then use it, which uses one fewer turn)
maybe bumping an obstacle makes your speed go to zero and you take 
damage! so you will learn to stop yourself. AHAHAHAHHA
eeeeeeexcellent

a little pffffffft shower of snow particles when you turn and stop
haha that's really going to happen in 7drl...


general suspicious slowdown after adding game state code





music hand drum 4 drummers tremor, long patterns overlapping sometimes syncing the main "theme" on more than one drum

music that's faster for combat. same music or different? anyway it speeds up in combat and goes back to normal later

sound effect - hum of warp gate increases with proximity

check floodfill of level before barrels because they can be destroyed. 

sometimes can't get into house because door inaccessible
 due to edge of map

make henge stones items too so can bomb? or floodtest

ripples on pond

if you ever destroy a lantern regen lighting
when you activate a cairn, redo lighting (dostaticlights())

stop player turning lantern on and off it's always on

make walls item not map feature so you can blow em up





another idea: item: fishing kit: get fish from water. hp back
or even eat fish - low hp regain, be standing on blood when
ignited, fish gets fried. full hp back on eat. almost becomes
like an adventure game

bugs that don't matter that much. resist urge to fix!
problem:trees generating in snow-topped boulders
reason:boulders take a free space then slide to the edge. they need to 
put that free space back or only peek at it if possible, then they need to unfreespace what they land on. the slide has to check for trees and cairns by checking itemgrid is null, not just check displaychar

stretch goals:
mobs other than polarmoops and skaters are now stretch goals
actually having to go through the game 4 times with same levels is stretch goal


eventually, not 7drl:

procedural blood
