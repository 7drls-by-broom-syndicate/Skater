do something about lanterns. maybe outside buildings

for the love of god, skating

music hand drum 4 drummers tremor, long patterns overlapping sometimes syncing the main "theme" on more than one drum

music that's faster for combat. same music or different? anyway it speeds up in combat and goes back to normal later



check floodfill of level before barrels because they can be destroyed. 

sometimes can't get into house because door inaccessible
 due to edge of map

make henge stones items too so can bomb? or floodtest

ripples on pond

if you ever destroy a lantern regen lighting
when you activate a cairn, redo lighting (dostaticlights())

stop player turning lantern on and off it's always on

make walls item not map feature so you can blow em up

movement: if you press any direction you go in that direction except for straight back, which just stops you. you need this so you can stop in front of cairns, barrels etc.

pathfinding crash. check a* code in both 
also warning/error on clicking somewhere unreachable

another idea: item: fishing kit: get fish from water. hp back
or even eat fish - low hp regain, be standing on blood when
ignited, fish gets fried. full hp back on eat. almost becomes
like an adventure game

stretch goals:
mobs other than polarmoops and skaters are now stretch goals
actually having to go through the game 4 times with same levels is stretch goal


eventually, not 7drl:

procedural blood
