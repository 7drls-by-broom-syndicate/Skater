music hand drum 4 drummers tremor, long patterns overlapping sometimes syncing the main "theme" on more than one drum

music that's faster for combat. same music or different? anyway it speeds up in combat and goes back to normal later

make house simple rectangle with one hole. you can make multi room houses later if you want but this is not a critical feature

do barrels drunken walk. greater chance of barrels in house. check floodfill of level before barrels because they can be destroyed. the more barrels you generate the lower the chance of getting something



push lanterns to walls fix background to snow?

cairns and barrels have to be drawn on background actually so maybe make lanterns do it too

if you ever destroy a lantern regen lighting
when you activate a cairn, redo lighting (dostaticlights())

stop player turning lantern on and off it's always on





movement: if you press any direction you go in that direction except for straight back, which just stops you. you need this so you can stop in front of cairns, barrels etc.

pathfinding crash. check a* code in both 


another idea: item: fishing kit: get fish from water. hp back
or even eat fish - low hp regain, be standing on blood when
ignited, fish gets fried. full hp back on eat. almost becomes
like an adventure game

stretch goals:
mobs other than polarmoops and skaters are now stretch goals
actually having to go through the game 4 times with same levels is stretch goal


eventually, not 7drl:

procedural blood
